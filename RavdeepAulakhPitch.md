## Introduction: ##
In this proposal, I will outline my plan for contributing 1000 lines of code to our project that will be made using Processing.org libraries. The game will be simpler than the real Doodle Jump, and I will create the player class, platform class, power-up class, and their respective methods. I will also likely make other classes that we come up with along the way but for now these are the main ones I wil be focusing on.

## Objectives: ##
My objectives for this project are to:

Create the player class with its methods.
Create the platform class with its methods.
Create the power-up class with its methods.
Implement the necessary functionalities to enable the game to run smoothly.

## What I will do: ##
To achieve these objectives, I will:

Read the documentation about processing.org libraries to get a better understanding of what I can do and how I can do it.
Implement the required functionalities and methods for each class while trying to follow correct design patterns and communicate with group members to make sure all of the code is working and makes sense.
Refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.
I will also try to document my code as well as I can so that teammates and anyone reading the code in the future can easily understand it.

## Conclusion: ##
My part in this project will mostly consist of programming the main classes and their methods. Since my other group members will be the ones to test the code and to possibly refactor some of it if it doesn't work or follow the correct design pattern I will need to make sure it is well documented so they can quickly understand what each method is and how to test it or why it might not be working.
