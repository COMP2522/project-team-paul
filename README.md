## How to Play the Game
### Basics
You can move left and right using <b>*A*</b> and
<b>*D*</b> keys, or you can also use the <b>*Right*</b>
and <b>*Left*</b> arrow keys. The player will automatically
jump when he hits a platform. To shoot projectiles you
can press <b>*Space Bar*</b> and they will be shot straight up
from your current position. You start off with 3 lives
and lose 1 life everytime you die until you have 0 lives
left at which point the game will end. Finally, your score 
is displayed in the top left corner of the game.

### Platforms
The game will generate *<b>green</b>* and *<b>red</b>* 
platforms which you the player can jump off of. These
platforms will move down the screen until they fall off.
The green platforms are normal and will let you 
jump off of them as many times as you want whereas 
the red one's will break after one jump.

### Enemies
The game also contains enemies. Enemies will spawn in
randomly and at random locations in the game. They
move down at the same speed as platforms and can be
killed by hitting them with projectiles. But beware
as colliding with enemies will take a life from you.

### Boss
There is a boss in the game that will appear once
per game. He spawns at score 2000. The boss takes
3 hits from the players projectiles to kill. The boss
spawns at the top of the window and moves left and right
while shooting projectiles down at the player. Colliding
with either the boss or his projectiles will cause you
to lose a life.

### Power Ups
The game also has power ups. They are the squares
with question marks in them and when the player 
collides with them, they will either be jumped up
similar to how a platform might or they will gain a
life as long as they have less than 3 lives. The 
power ups spawn in random locations in the window.

### Coins
The player can collect coins as well throughout
the game which will increase they're overall score.
The coins are the spinning gold coins and appear
randomly throughout the window.
